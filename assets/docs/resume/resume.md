## Professional Summary

Self-taught AI Builder and founder who ships production-grade systems solo and on small teams. Built a native-Rust financial-intelligence terminal (+37% paper-trade ROI) and a privacy-first, on-device voice-to-text app — both cross-platform desktop products. Hardware-fluent (Aircraft A&P coursework, CompTIA A+) with end-to-end ownership from systems and data pipelines through UI and go-to-market. Inaugural cohort of Pursuit's AI-Native Builder program.
